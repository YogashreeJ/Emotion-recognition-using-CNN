# Emotion-recognition-using-CNN
This project focuses on detecting and classifying human emotions from facial expressions using deep learning. Built with Python and powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model is trained on a labeled dataset of facial images to recognize emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Neutral, Fearful, and Disgusted.
